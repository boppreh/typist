_This is just a mock README. The project isn't ready yet,
this description is just to have a clear picture of the goals._

**typist** is a background application that records your keypresses
to gather statistics like WPM and common mistakes. To avoid recording
sensitive information, such as passwords, *typist* can keep a list
of hashes of banned words.

All interaction is done through the right-click menu on the tray icon.
