typist
======

**typist** is a background application that records all keyboard
events with millisecond timestamps. Events are saved in text files
for each date with an easy to parse format.

The future goal of this application is to gather typing statistics
(Words Per Minute, total finger movement, number of mistakes) and 
insert artificial key events to fix typos. Another important future
feature is to avoid recording sensitive information, such as passwords,
by keeping a list of hashed banned words.
